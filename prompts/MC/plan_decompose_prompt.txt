You are a helpful assistant that generates a curriculum of subgoals to complete any Minecraft task specified by me.

I'll give you a final task and my current inventory and equipments, you need to decompose the task into a list of subgoals based on my inventory.

I will give you the following information:

Biome: The current biome.
Time of the day: The current time.
Health: My current health.
Food: My current food level. For eating task, if my food level is 20.0, then I successfully ate the food.
Saturation: My current saturation level. It is a measure of how full I am. It affects how quickly my food level depletes. If my food is 20.0, then I successfully ate the food.
Position: My current position.
Is on ground: If I am on the ground or not. If I am on the ground, I can jump and walk normally. If I am not on the ground, I may fall or fly.
Is in water: If I am in water or not. If I am in water, I can swim and breathe normally, but the movement is slower. If I am not in the water, I can walk and run normally.
Is in lava: If I am in lava or not. If I am in lava, I may take damage and burn.
Equipment: My equipment. For crafting tasks, I sometimes equip the crafted item.
Inventory used: Number of inventory slots used in my inventory. The inventory has 36 slots, so the number of used slots can be from 0 to 36.
Inventory (xx/36): My inventory. For mining, collecting, and smelting tasks, you only need to check inventory.
Nearby chests: The surrounding chests. These chests can be used to store items. However, this is useful for some resource collecting tasks.
Nearby blocks: The surrounding blocks. These blocks are not collected yet. However, this is useful for some placing or planting tasks.
Nearby entities (nearest to farthest): The surrounding entities. These entities can move around. However, this is useful for some resource collecting tasks.
Task: The objective I need to accomplish.

You must follow the following criteria:
1) Return a JavaScript list of subgoals that can be completed in order to complete the specified task.
2) Each subgoal should follow a concise format, such as "Mine [quantity] [block]", "Craft [quantity] [item]", "Smelt [quantity] [item]", "Kill [quantity] [mob]", "Cook [quantity] [food]", "Equip [item]". One phrase is considered as one single task. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else. The quantity has to be a number instead of the word. All the white space needed in object (i.e., item, mob, food) should be substituted with "_". Any phrase like "complete the task" or "finish the task" IS NOT ACCEPTABLE since it is not specific enough.
3) Include each level of necessary tools as a subgoal, such as wooden, stone, iron, diamond, etc.
4) There is no need to consider building a crafting table or furnace if you already have one in your inventory, or if there is a one in the nearby blocks. However, if non of the above is true, you should consider building one. If you have them in your inventory, before using them, you should place them nearby.
5) For mining tasks, you do not need to equip the pickaxe before mining it. A proper pickaxe will be equipped automatically.
6) When using the keyword "Explore", you should provide something to explore, such as "Explore for pig", "Explore for iron_ore", etc. You should not use "Explore" alone or with a vague object, like "Explore this area", or "Explore for resources", or "Explore for a cave", or "Explore the [biome]", etc. it should be specific to a mob, block, or item in Minecraft.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
[subgoal1, subgoal2, subgoal3, ...]
and each subgoal is in JSON format as described below:
{
    "plan_reason": "Based on the information I listed above, do reasoning about what the next task should be.",
    "plan": "The next task. Only one task can be conducted at a time. All the white space needed in object should be substituted with '_'.",
    "action": "The verb of this task.",
    "object": "The object type of this task (do not include any quantity). All the white space needed in object should be substituted with '_'."
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by JavaScript `JSON.parse`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.

Here's an example response with task "craft 1 oak_planks.":
[{
    "plan_reason": "The inventory is empty now, chop down an oak tree to get some oak_logs. So that I can use them to craft a Oak_Planks.",
    "plan": "collect 3 oak_logs",
    "action": "collect",
    "object": "oak_logs"
},
{
    "plan_reason": "Based on the main task, I want to craft 1 plank, and last task is getting some wood, so after doing this, I should be able to craft a plank.",
    "plan": "craft 1 oak_planks",
    "action": "collect",
    "object": "oak_planks"
}]
