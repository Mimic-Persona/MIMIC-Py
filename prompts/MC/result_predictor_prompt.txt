You are a helpful assistant to produce the expected result for my next task to do in Minecraft. My goal is to use the information you provided to judge if my next task is completed successfully or not.

I will give you the following information:
Plan: The task will be performed by me.
Plan reason: The reason for the task.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
{
    "reasoning": "reasoning",
    "quantity": number,
    "items": ["item1", "item2", ...]
}
Ensure the response can be parsed by JavaScript `JSON.parse`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, etc.

Answer
{
    "reasoning": "unknown",
    "quantity": 0,
    "items": ["unknown"]
}
if you don't know the answer.

You will give the expected change of items in my inventory or equipment based on the context (only if available and helpful) and your own knowledge of Minecraft.
1) All the quantity should be based on the number of the task.
  Bad example (the quantity is not the same as the task):
    Task: mine 1 dirt
    {
        "reasoning": "...",
        "quantity": 3,
        "items": ["dirt"]
    }
2) All the items should be based on the item drop of this task in Minecraft.
  Bad example (the item drop contradicts the rule in Minecraft):
    Task: kill 1 pig
    {
        "reasoning": "...",
        "quantity": 1,
        "items": ["dirt"]
    }
3) All the items might drop from the task in Minecraft should be included in the item.
  Bad example (the item not included all the possible item drops from the task in Minecraft):
    Task: kill 1 sheep
    {
        "reasoning": "...",
        "quantity": 1,
        "items": ["mutton"]
    }
4) All the item name should be the one shown in Minecraft with '_' instead of ' '.
  Bad example (the item shown is using ' ' instead of '_'):
    Task: mine 1 coal_ore
    {
        "reasoning": "...",
        "quantity": 1,
        "items": ["coal ore"]
    }
  Bad example (the item is not a valid name in Minecraft):
    Task: mine 1 coal_ore
    {
        "reasoning": "unknown",
        "quantity": 1,
        "items": ["coal"]
    }

Here are some task and expected result examples:
Task: mine 4 dirt
{
    "reasoning": "The task is mining dirt with quantity 4. So, the quantity should be 4. Since in Minecraft, mining dirt gives itme 'dirt', the expected item should be 'dirt' only.",
    "quantity": 4,
    "items": ["dirt"]
}
Task: kill 1 sheep
{
    "reasoning": "The task is killing sheep with quantity 1. So, the quantity should be 1. Since in Minecraft, killing sheep gives 'mutton' or 'wool', the expected item should be 'mutton' and 'wool'."
    "quantity": 1,
    "items": ["mutton", "wool"]
}
Task: Craft 1 wooden_pickaxe.
{
    "reasoning": "The task is crafting a wooden pickaxe with quantity 1. So, the quantity should be 1. Since in Minecraft, crafting a wooden pickaxe make the number of wooden pickaxe in inventory increase by 1.",
    "quantity": 1,
    "items": ["wooden_pickaxe"]
}

Here is the current task:
