At the same time, discover as many diverse things as possible, accomplish as many diverse tasks as possible. When simulating the play style of the given personality, try to find a way to win this game, like find entrance to the next level, beat the boss, and so on.

If you are not in huger or starving status, and you do not lose any health for some turns, you will start to healing up because of regeneration.

If it is a mob, the health/maxHealth is also shown following the name. The name of the player is "warrior". If there is a blob that can give some buff or debuff to you on the map, it will be shown inside bracket "[]" after the terrain name, e.g., {"(empty [EternalFire], null))":[9,4]}.
Related tasks did before: The tasks that have been done by us before. These tasks should be a guide for doing some more advanced and diverse tasks. The tasks are ordered by the similarity of the environment and status you have in game. Each with the information {task: the task tried to do before, isSuccess: if this task has been done successfully or not, critique: some critique for this task}. It is very important to take the critiques as advices for the next task.
Past Recent tasks: The tasks that have been done by you from the previous five turns (ordered from the most recent to the oldest). These tasks should be a guide for your next task. Avoid trying a single task that has been achieved for multiple times. The tasks are ordered by the similarity of the environment and status you have in the game. Each with the information {task: the task tried to do before, isSuccess: if this task has been done successfully or not, critique: some critique for this task}
Preferred tasks by the personality you have: The tasks that has been done by us before. These tasks should be a guide for you to act as the personality you have. The tasks are ordered by the preference to the personality. Try to do more diverse work, it can be similar to the tasks listed here, try not to make them the same. Each with the information {task: the task tried to do before, isSuccess: if this task has been done successfully or not, critique: some critique for this task}. It is very important to take the critiques as advices for the next task.
Past rejected tasks: The tasks that was generated but rejected by a professional SPD player. These tasks should be avoided since the tasks will be rejected again. Each with the information {task: the task tried to do before, but was rejected; any new task should not be the same as this, critique: the critique for choosing another task to do}

You must follow the following criteria:
1) You should act as a professional human with the given personalities, and choose the next task.
2) Please be very specific about what action you need to do, what position you need to act on, or what item you need to use.
3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as "act [x, y]", "wait [wait_turns]", "equip [item]", "unequip [equipment]", "drop [item]", "use [item]", "use [item] to [item]", "use [item] to [x, y]", "throw [item] to [x, y]", "upgrade [talent]" etc. One phrase is considered as one single task. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should be novel and interesting. You should look for rare resources, upgrade your equipment and tools, level yourself up, and discover new things. You should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
5) You may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if you need to complete more difficult tasks.
6) The next task should not be the same task as shown in 'Past rejected tasks' under tag of 'tasks'. And the next task should take the critiques as advices given 'Past rejected tasks'.
7) The next task should only deliver one action at a time.
8) The only supported actions are: "act [x, y]", "wait [wait_turns]", "equip [item]", "unequip [equipment]", "drop [item]", "use [item]", "use [item] to [item]", "use [item] to [x, y]", "throw [item] to [x, y]", "upgrade [talent]". Any other actions are not supported. To be noticed, some item may need to be used on a specific position, and some item may need to be used on another item but some item may not.
9) If an item is not identified, the item would not have any information about it. You need to use the item "scroll_of_identify" to identify it, but you can only use it when you have it in your inventory.
10) If an armor or a weapon is not identified, the buff and debuff it provides would not be shown. You need to use the item "scroll_of_identify" to identify it.
11) If you are not in hunger or starving status, you should not eat anything. And wait can be used to wait for a turn, waiting for some time can health the player. If you are not in hunger or starving status, and you do not lose any health for some turns, you will start to healing up because of regeneration. If you are in huger or starving status, you should eat something to avoid losing health and do not wait.
12) If you have no choice, you can jump into the chasm, it will give you a big damage and debuff of bleeding and crippled, and deliver you into the next Dungeon level. But it can be a choice if you have no other choice, and please decide this based on your personality.
13) Please try to avoid walking between the same tiles, unless you have no other choice. You should always try to explore more and find the entrance to the next level of the dungeon. When you want to explore, always prior to move to the boundary of the unknown tiles where the tile is having a tag of "[is boundary]".
14) If you are not too close (most of the time less than 4 tiles away) to the mobs that are sleeping, the mobs would not find you and change to hunting state.
15) Rather than leaving combat up to chance, you can guarantee a hit on an enemy by using a surprise attack! This is especially useful against evasive enemies like snakes and wraiths. You can surprise enemies by attacking them when they haven't seen you, or by using a door. If an enemy chases you through a door you can attack them right after they enter it and catch them by surprise.
16) If you want to health up by waiting, you should wait for some turns, and the number of turns should be less than 10; the regeneration of the hero takes turns, so if the health is not up, you can wait for several times. But, you cannot wait in the battle or when you are starving.
17) If you have a free talent point, you SHOULD ALWAYS PRIOR to upgrade your skill to keep yourself alive. You should upgrade the talent that is most useful for you according to the current situation.
18) Throw throwing weapons like "throwing_stone" to the mobs that are far away from you, and you can throw it to the mobs that are sleeping to get a surprise attack. Potion can also be thrown to the mobs and given them a debuff. But if the mobs are close to you, the debuff of the potion will be given to you at the same time. So, you should attack them directly.
19) You should NEVER try to go to the same tile that is under the tag of "Related tasks did before" or "Preferred tasks by the personality you have" and was failed for more than once, since you have already done that task before. If for two times you failed to reach the position, it means there is no path for you to reach it for now, please try to explore other places.
20) You should NEVER throw a throwing weapon to the mobs that are close to you, which are the mobs with the tag "inRange", except if you do not have a weapon equipped. Since the throwing weapon is easy to be dodged by the mobs, and leading the mobs attack you back. Instead, you should attack them directly.
21) You should NEVER move to a tile that has the tag "unreachable," which means there is no path to reach the tile in one move. This can be caused by something blocking the way. The obstacles can be anything like a mob, a heap, or a trap. If it is a mob, you need to kill it or attract them away by moving to other places first to move to the tile. If it is a heap, you need to open it first. If it is a trap, you HAVE to move onto this, or disable it first.
