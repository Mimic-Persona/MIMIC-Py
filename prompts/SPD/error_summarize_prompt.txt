If it is a mob, the health/maxHealth is also shown following the name. The name of the player is "warrior". If there is a blob that can give some buff or debuff to you on the map, it will be shown inside bracket "[]" after the terrain name, e.g., {"(empty [EternalFire], null))":[9,4]}.

Here are some criteria used for the action planning which you can refer to when you are providing critique:
1) You should act as a professional human with the given personalities, and choose the next task.
2) Please be very specific about what action you need to do, what position you need to act on, or what item you need to use.
3) The next task should follow a concise format, such as "act [x, y]", "wait [wait_turns]", "equip [item]", "unequip [equipment]", "drop [item]", "use [item]", "use [item] to [item]", "use [item] to [x, y]", "throw [item] to [x, y]", "upgrade [talent]" etc. One phrase is considered as one single task. Do not propose multiple tasks at the same time. Do not mention anything else.
4) The next task should be novel and interesting. You should look for rare resources, upgrade your equipment and tools, level yourself up, and discover new things. You should not be doing the same thing over and over again.
5) You may sometimes need to repeat some tasks if you need to complete more difficult tasks.
6) The next task should not be the same task as shown in 'Past rejected tasks' under tag of 'tasks'. And the next task should take the critiques as advices given 'Past rejected tasks'.
7) The next task should only deliver one action at a time.
8) The only supported actions are: "act [x, y]", "wait [wait_turns]", "equip [item]", "unequip [equipment]", "drop [item]", "use [item]", "use [item] to [item]", "use [item] to [x, y]", "throw [item] to [x, y]", "upgrade [talent]". Any other actions are not supported. To be noticed, some item may need to be used on a specific position, and some item may need to be used on another item but some item may not.
9) If an item is not identified, the item would not have any information about it. You need to use the item "scroll_of_identify" to identify it, but you can only use it when you have it in your inventory.
10) If an armor or a weapon is not identified, the buff and debuff it provides would not be shown. You need to use the item "scroll_of_identify" to identify it.
11) If you are not in hunger or starving status, you should not eat anything. And wait can be used to wait for a turn, waiting for some time can health the player. If you are not in hunger or starving status, and you do not lose any health for some turns, you will start to healing up because of regeneration. If you are in huger or starving status, you should eat something to avoid losing health and do not wait.
12) If you have no choice, you can jump into the chasm, it will give you a big damage and debuff of bleeding and crippled, and deliver you into the next Dungeon level. But it can be a choice if you have no other choice, and please decide this based on your personality.
13) Please try to avoid walking between the same tiles, unless you have no other choice. You should always try to explore more and find the entrance to the next level of the dungeon. When you want to explore, always prior to move to the boundary of the unknown tiles where the tile is having a tag of "[is boundary]".
14) If you are not too close (most of the time less than 4 tiles away) to the mobs that are sleeping, the mobs would not find you and change to hunting state.
15) Rather than leaving combat up to chance, you can guarantee a hit on an enemy by using a surprise attack! This is especially useful against evasive enemies like snakes and wraiths. You can surprise enemies by attacking them when they haven't seen you, or by using a door. If an enemy chases you through a door you can attack them right after they enter it and catch them by surprise.
16) If you want to health up by waiting, you should wait for some turns, and the number of turns should be less than 10; the regeneration of the hero takes turns, so if the health is not up, you can wait for several times. But, you cannot wait in the battle or when you are starving.
17) If you have a free talent point, you SHOULD ALWAYS PRIOR to upgrade your skill to keep yourself alive. You should upgrade the talent that is most useful for you according to the current situation.
18) Throw throwing weapons like "throwing_stone" to the mobs that are far away from you, and you can throw it to the mobs that are sleeping to get a surprise attack. Potion can also be thrown to the mobs and given them a debuff. But if the mobs are close to you, the debuff of the potion will be given to you at the same time. So, you should attack them directly.
19) You should NEVER try to go to the same tile that is under the tag of "Related tasks did before" or "Preferred tasks by the personality you have" and was failed for more than once, since you have already done that task before. If for two times you failed to reach the position, it means there is no path for you to reach it for now, please try to explore other places.
20) You should NEVER throw a throwing weapon to the mobs that are close to you, which are the mobs with the tag "inRange", except if you do not have a weapon equipped. Since the throwing weapon is easy to be dodged by the mobs, and leading the mobs attack you back. Instead, you should attack them directly.
21) You should NEVER move to a tile that has the tag "unreachable," which means there is no path to reach the tile in one move. This can be caused by something blocking the way. The obstacles can be anything like a mob, a heap, or a trap. If it is a mob, you need to kill it or attract them away by moving to other places first to move to the tile. If it is a heap, you need to open it first. If it is a trap, you HAVE to move onto this, or disable it first.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below:
{
    "summary": "summary",
    "is_success": boolean,
    "critique": "critique"
}

Here are some examples:
INPUT:
Error Message: "The tile cannot be reached."

Task: Act [25, 34].
{
    "summary": "According to the error message, it means the tile is unreachable. This can be caused by 2 reasons: 1. The tile is out of map. 2. Some obstacles like skeleton heap or closed door needed to be moved for reaching such tile.",
    "is_success": false,
    "critique": "You should check the map and make sure the tile is reachable. If it is not reachable for now, you should find a way to reach it. If it is out of map, you should explore other tiles."
}

Ensure the response can be parsed by JavaScript `JSON.parse`, e.g.: no trailing commas, no single quotes, DO NOT CONTAIN THE ANSWER WITH ''```json'...'```' etc.
